Docker Hub Repository Link
==========================

Repository: https://hub.docker.com/r/elton2/ecommerce-web

IMPORTANT: HOW TO RUN THIS APPLICATION
======================================

This application requires Docker Compose (not just the Docker image alone).

To run the application:
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to project directory
3. Run: docker-compose up --build
4. Access: http://localhost:8000

The docker-compose.yml file orchestrates both the web container (Django)
and database container (MariaDB) to work together.

Running the Docker image alone will fail with:
"nc: getaddrinfo for host 'db' port 3306: Name or service not known"

This is expected because the web container needs the database container.
